One visualization that is almost always used in most dashboards is the **CARD**. The card highlights a single, important metric so that it stands out immediately. Below are 4 cards

One shows the revenue, the second, the Total Profit, the third, the total Orders and the fourth, the Return Rate.

Another visualization is the **KPI** card. It is designed to instantly communicate performance against a target, making it one of the most effective visuals for executive‑level dashboards.

<img width="1360" height="720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/327260c3-6f51-4a25-8e0d-7369a9cc9e82" />

                                                                                                                                                                          
From the image, we can see that the Monthly Revenue KPI card shows that the current month's revenue surpassed last month's revenue by 3.31%.
Total orders however reduced from 2165 to 2146 and that is why it is red. There was also a reduction in returns from 169 to 166 which, in this case is a good thing.

A **MATRIX** visual in Power BI is designed to display data in a structured, pivot‑table‑style layout, making it ideal for exploring data across multiple dimensions.

Looking at the highlighted Matrix, the formatting in the Orders bars shows the relative differences in the number of orders for each product and thus we can decide which product we should make sure is always available. For the Return rate bar, the highest values had a very red color to highlight the bad ones.
Also, using the Top N filter, the matrix showed only the Top 10 highest orders sold, with Water Bottles at the top.

A **DONUT** visual in Power BI is designed to show how a whole is divided into parts, while keeping the focus on the proportions of each category.
<img width="1920" height="1128" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8667b135-dd5d-42ad-982e-e93c536dd10d" />

Using the donut visuals, we were able to show the composition of customers by Income level and Occupation.
The analysis tells us the customer with the highest revenue, in our case it was Mr Maurice Shan as shown in the textbox and table.

A **MAP** visual in Power BI is designed to show data in a geographic context, making it easy to understand how metrics vary across locations. The map visual, in this case was used to visualize data by continent and country and to compare performance across regions.


This image shows all the geographical locations, bubble size indicating the number of orders for each region.

The second map visual shows Europe and countries in Europe with their corresponding total number of orders, United Kingdom having a total of 2771 orders.

Another visualization in Power Bi is a **GUAGE** chart. A gauge visual in Power BI is designed to show progress toward a target in a simple, intuitive way. It’s one of the clearest visuals for communicating performance status at a glance and it is used for displaying a single KPI (e.g., sales, revenue, profit, utilization), showing how close the current value is to a goal, highlighting whether performance is low, on track, or exceeding expectations and providing a quick, dashboard‑friendly indicator of status

<img width="1920" height="1128" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3272da38-fc0f-4b33-94c4-d8fd628fe6f6" />
The chart tells us that we are yet to hit our Monthly targets and Monthly Revenue for Bike Wash - Dissolver even though the Monthly Profit has been met. Using the slicer beside the guage chart, we can find out which products are hitting their targets or not. The unmet targets are shown in red while the met target is shown in black.
