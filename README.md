One visualization that is almost always used in most dashboards is the Card. The card highlights a single, important metric so that it stands out immediately. Below are 4 cards

One shows the revenue, the second, the Total Profit, the third, the total Orders and the fourth, the Return Rate.

Another visualization is the KPI card. It is designed to instantly communicate performance against a target, making it one of the most effective visuals for executive‑level dashboards.

From the image, we can see that the Monthly Revenue KPI card shows that the current month's revenue surpassed last month's revenue by 3.31%.
Total orders however reduced from 2165 to 2146 and that is why it is red. The returns was also good, it reduced from 169 to 166.

A matrix visual in Power BI is designed to display data in a structured, pivot‑table‑style layout, making it ideal for exploring data across multiple dimensions.

Looking at the highlighted Matrix, the formatting in the Orders bars shows the relative differences in the number of orders for each product and thus we can decide which product we hould make sure is always available. For the Return rate bar, the highest values had a very red color to highlight the bad ones.
Also, using the Top N filter, the matrix showed only the Top 10 highest orders sold, with Water Bottles at the top.

A donut visual in Power BI is designed to show how a whole is divided into parts, while keeping the focus on the proportions of each category.

The analysis tells us the customer with the highest revenue, in our case it was Mr Maurice Shan as shown in the card and table. Using the donut charts beside the table, we can find the top customers based on Income level and Occupation.

The following images are map visuals to show orders by geographical locations.

Another image in Power Bi is Guage charts. Shown below are guage charts.

The chart tells us that we are yet to hit our Monthly targets and Monthly Revenue for Bike Wash - Dissolver even though the Monthly Profit has been met. The unmet targets are shown in red while the met target is shown in black.
